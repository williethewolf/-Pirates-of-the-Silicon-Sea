Taking turns, the players attack each other until one of the ship's hull health is 0. Sails work as a buffer against damage with 30% chance of receiving damage. If sail's health reaches 0, all the damage will be absorbed by the hull.

# Future Enhancements
-**Single player experience:** Where the AI takes control of the second player.

-**Fleets!:** Both player and Enemy can have fleets consisting of multiple ships.

-**Scoring System:** Defeating or capturing adversary ships will allow you to earn gold for upgrades.

-**Upgrades:** Especial encounters with trading posts will allow to improve the ship.

-**Crews, moral and Boarding:** Crews can board enemy ships for a better loot yield and the chance of surrender if moral is too low.

-**And more** ***swashbuckling*** **action!**
